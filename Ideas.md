# Number interpolation ie:
``` 
23{7}4       # 2,374
1{2.4}4      # 12.44
22{3}4.4{3}5 # 2234.435
``` 

# Indentation and ⧼⧽ both required or using tabs or more than one space will result in a runtime error.
Indentation is bad for your health and the readability of your code.

# Some random case (aLtErNaTe cAsE, tOGGLE cASE,  StudlyCaps Case, etc) for standard functions (I get annoyed at Java for using lowerCamelCase and CamelCase depending on if its a class, object, method etc).
