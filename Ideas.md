# Use new when calling a function ie: 
```printf(new funtion_name(args))``` for java.

# Number interpolation ie:
``` 
23{7}4       # 2,374
1{2.4}4      # 12.44
22{3}4.4{3}5 # 2234.435
``` 
#### Note you can use variables, function, and other things too.


# Indentation and {} both required ie:
```
if (expr) {
  do this;
  if (expr) {
    do this
    }
  }
```
# Array, string and other sybscripts start at one, thanks Lua.
```
hello: int = [2,5,5,5]
print(hello[1]) # displays 2
``` 
#### Note the syntax is not final, its just meant to show this idea.

# Some random case (aLtErNaTe cAsE, tOGGLE cASE,  StudlyCaps Case, etc) for standard functions.

# Comparison operator (equals, less than) will have to be in two letter form ie:
```
if (i eq 5) {
  code;
  }
```
eq for equals, ne for not equals.
lt for less than, gt for greater than.
le for less than or equals, ge for greater than or equals.
!(), for not ie :
```
if (!(tRuE) {
  code;
  }
```
#### note some things like if and not may change syntaticly.
