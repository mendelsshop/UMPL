globals must be initilized!!!
allocas should be in a functions entry block
prefer inserting instead of const struct unless you are sure you are only using constants
when doing conditnals and phis alway get the latest place the builder is at for case or else the phi will be messed up


inkwell specific
all builder instructions return results now but most of them are only for when the builder positio isn't set in which case i just unwrap here is the list of the function
build_store, build_alloca, build_load, build_call, build_int_compare, build_unreachable, build_int_signed_rem, build_indirect_call, build_and, build_or, build_int_cast, build_select, build_int_truncate - todo replace the unwraps on these calls with expects or feature ate them in inkwell
