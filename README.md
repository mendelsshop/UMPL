# compiler
This my compiler and languge made in rust, and also how I'm learning rust.
<br>
The name of the languge is: UMPL (Unnamed Meme Programming Language).
<br>
It is a meme programming language as the name suggests.
<br>
If you have any Ideas for the language put contribute them in [this file](https://github.com/mendelsshop/compiler/blob/main/Ideas.txt)
<br>
along with an example or two according of how to use it in the language.
