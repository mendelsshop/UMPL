# UMPL
If you have any Ideas for the language put contribute them in [this file](https://github.com/mendelsshop/compiler/blob/main/Ideas.md)
<br>
along with an example or two according of how to use it in the language.
<br>
With UMPL we stive to break backwards compatibility, so have fun trying to write the same code for different versions of the language, if this project even last long enough.
<br>
To see example code for UMPL you can see [this directory](https://github.com/mendelsshop/UMPL/tree/main/umpl_examples), and to look at the formal language grammar refer to [this file](https://github.com/mendelsshop/UMPL/blob/main/grammer.md).
<br>
variables in UMPL must follow the kebab-case naming convention and have no uppercase letters.
<br>
Too see the understand the keywords and their meaning, refer to [this file](https://github.com/mendelsshop/UMPL/blob/main/keywords.md).
<br>
There is semi working vscode extension for UMPL, you can find it [here](https://github.com/mendelsshop/UMPL_VSCode_Extension)
<br>
At UMPL to fix the null problem, we have invented a new type called hempty, which is the same as null, but it sounds better, and it adds to the long list of\ null like types across all the proggraming languages.
<br> 
All bug reports head straight to /dev/hempty
