# UMPL
This my compiler and languge made in rust, and also how I'm learning rust.
<br>
The name of the languge is: UMPL (Unnamed Meme Programming Language).
<br>
It is a meme programming language as the name suggests.
<br>
If you have any Ideas for the language put contribute them in [this file](https://github.com/mendelsshop/compiler/blob/main/Ideas.md)
<br>
along with an example or two according of how to use it in the language.
<br>
With UMPL we try to break backwards compatibility, so have fun trying to write the same code for different versions of the language.
<br>
To see example code for UMPL you can see [this directory](https://github.com/mendelsshop/UMPL/tree/main/umpl_examples), and to look at the formal language grammar refer to [this file](https://github.com/mendelsshop/UMPL/blob/main/grammer.md).
<br>
variables in UMPL must follow the kebab-case naming convention and have no uppercase letters.
